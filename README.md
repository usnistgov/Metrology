# Software metrology

**Helping physical scientists and computer scientists understand one another a
little bit better so that metrology (the science of measurement) and science
generally (the system of human knowledge) will be more cohesive across
disciplines**

This is the repository of the software metrology project of the [Information
Technology Laboratory](https://www.nist.gov/itl) of the US [National
Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov).
