The Chrome Reaper
=================

Reaper is a Chrome (or Chromium) browser extension that terminates browser
processes when they use too much CPU.  Likely targets include:

- Cryptominers
- rowhammer.js
- Web pages that enter a busy loop when ads are blocked
- Web pages and extensions that contain broken code
- Web pages and extensions that are extremely bloated and slow

When Reaper terminates a process, typically a web page goes blank or an
extension dies suddenly.  So there is no mystery why this occurred, you get a
push notification that looks something like this:

<img src="reaper-notification.png" alt="Reaper notification" width=345 height=64>

The rest of the time, Reaper shows itself to be active by displaying the
total CPU utilization of the browser in a small icon in your address bar.

Permissions
===========

The extension requires the following permissions/APIs:

- processes:  needed for the core function of monitoring and terminating processes.
- notifications:  needed to notify the user when a process is terminated.
- storage:  needed to save settings.
- tabs:  needed to determine hostnames for no-kill listing.

Problematically, the
[processes](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/processes) API is marked
as both "experimental" and "dev channel only."  However, it is possible to
enable it in the standard release of Chrome, as verified with Version
70.0.3538.77 (Official Build) (64-bit) for Mac, by following the installation
instructions below.


Installation Instructions
=========================

The extension uses an API that is marked "experimental."  Unfortunately, this
means it can't be distributed through the Chrome Web Store&mdash;you need to
install it manually.  Luckily, this is not difficult and only takes a minute:

1. Enable the experimental APIs
    1. Start Google Chrome
    2. Open up chrome://flags (this URL must be entered manually)
    3. Search for "Experimental Extension APIs" and enable <img src="experimental.png" text="Experimental mode">
    4. Relaunch Chrome for this to take effect (use the Relaunch button that appears at the bottom of the screen and all your open tabs will be preserved)

2. Install the extension
    1. Download either [Reaper-1.1.3.tar.xz](https://github.com/usnistgov/Metrology/blob/master/Reaper/Reaper-1.1.3.tar.xz) or [Reaper-1.1.3.zip](https://github.com/usnistgov/Metrology/blob/master/Reaper/Reaper-1.1.3.zip) (don't right-click; click through and then Download)
    2. Unpack the archive file somewhere permanent
    3. Select More Tools > Extensions from the Chrome menu or manually enter the URL chrome://extensions
    4. Ensure the "Developer mode" toggle at the top of the page is on, and click the "Load unpacked" button <img src="devmode.png" text="Developer mode">
    5. Browse to select the folder containing the files you've just unpacked
    6. The extension will appear in your address bar.

Do not delete the unpacked files after installation; the extension may fail
with "File Not Found" errors if you do.


Settings
========

To access and change settings, right click on Reaper's tiny icon in the
address bar and choose Options from the menu.

Threshold
---------

Reaper terminates a process when its CPU utilization consistently meets or
exceeds a threshold for a specified length of time.  The CPU threshold can be
adjusted between 10% and 90% in increments of 10%.  The time can be set to
various values ranging between 3 seconds and 30 seconds.

The default threshold of 90% utilization for 5 seconds will catch malware
that saturates the CPU while allowing a reasonable time for benign web pages
to finish rendering.  In most cases, reducing the time to 3 seconds will
improve reaction time without causing collateral damage.  However, on very
slow systems, the time might need to be increased to avoid terminating benign
web pages before they finish rendering.

Some cryptominers are designed to limit their CPU utilization to a level well
below 90% to avoid detection.  To detect these, one can specify a lower
utilization threshold combined with a longer time interval.

Since the appropriate CPU utilization threshold can vary based on the speed
of the computer, settings are saved only in local storage; they are never
synced to other devices.

No-kill list
------------

In the event that some extension or web site must be allowed to run even
though it may exceed the threshold, it can be exempted using the no-kill
list.  A process can be exempted in two ways:  by description or by hostname.

Every process has a description like "Tab: World News" or "Extension: Reaper"
that can be used to identify it.  For active processes, this description can
be obtained from the Task Manager (More Tools > Task Manager from the Chrome
menu).  For processes that Reaper has just terminated, it can be found in the
console log (see <a href="#log">Troubleshooting</a>) and in the push
notification.

Processes that are rendering web pages can furthermore be exempted by listing
the hostname that appears in the URL.  This allows an entire site to be
exempted, while a single page on the site could be exempted by description.

If listing a hostname seems not to work, check the URL of the terminated
process in the console log.  Sites are sometimes subtly redirected, e.g.,
from example.test to www.example.test.  You need to list the hostname that
was actually terminated.


Security
========

Reaper serves as a final, reactive layer of defense against cryptominers and
other in-browser malware that chews up CPU.  If something malicious is killed
by Reaper, this means that it got through all previous, proactive layers of
defense and was actively running in your browser.  If you or your security
officer determine that the suspicious item was indeed malicious, you/they
should take actions such as

- Adjust your blocker to block it
- Report it to your perimeter security team so they can block it
- Report it to [Google Safe Browsing](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/) and possibly [other similar services](https://decentsecurity.com/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/)
- Report it to their hosting company to take down the source

Reaper does no kind of filtering or identification of content; it only
monitors CPU utilization.

In terms of net risk, there is a tradeoff between Reaper's mitigation of
in-browser malware and the significant expansion of the attack surface and
weakening of browser defenses that results from enabling experimental APIs
and developer mode.


Privacy
=======

When Reaper terminates a process, the description and associated URL (if
available) are written to the console log and included in the push
notification.


Isolation Problem
=================

Certain Chrome isolation features are ineffective on Reaper.

- If multiple user profiles ("people") are active simultaneously, Reaper will
terminate processes belonging to user profiles other than the one in which
Reaper is installed.
- Reaper will terminate incognito processes even when Reaper's "Allow in
incognito" switch is turned off.

When a profile or incognito mode boundary is crossed, Reaper may be unable to
determine the URL associated with a process.  In that case, the URL will not
appear in the log, and no-kill listing the hostname will not work.


Other Known Problems
====================

The descriptions of processes are too long for push notifications.


<a name="log"></a>Troubleshooting
=================================

Reaper's attempts to terminate processes and possible failures can be found
in the extension's console log under Developer Tools.  To view the log:

1. Select More Tools > Extensions from the Chrome menu or manually enter the URL chrome://extensions
2. Under Reaper, next to Inspect views, click on background.html
3. Select the Console tab if it is not already selected
